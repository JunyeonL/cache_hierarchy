Cache Architecture Analysis Tool
================================

This is a tool for analyzing the detailed structure of the cache even if

is to analyze Cache Hierarchy, Cache size, Associativity and Cacheline size
according to memory access latency.

Some part of the source code comes from https://github.com/ob/cache.
